# DS 4002 Project 1

## For our first project, we are testing the following hypothesis: there are more fraudulent job postings (as a percentage) for remote jobs than in-person jobs. Our hypothesis is motivated by the increase in remote jobs since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. To help navigate our repository, adhere to the following sections. The "SOURCE" section shows how we install, build, and use our code. The "DATA" folder will enable you to see our data dictionary, a link to the Kaggle source, and notes about how we use the data. The "FIGURES" folder contains all of the figures produced and summarizes the takeaways. The "REFERENCES" section acknowledges the sources for our analysis.
